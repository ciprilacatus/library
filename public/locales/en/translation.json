    "1": "Vacation is the time when you decide to leave aside all the worries humming in the background, slow down the mechanism, take a deep breath of air (sea, mountain, forest, whatever you want) in your chest and direct your attention to the things that often they get lost in the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It's the opportunity to spend time with your loved ones, have adventures, and, perhaps more than ever, take refuge in the world of books."
